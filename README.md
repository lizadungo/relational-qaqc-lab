# Relational QAQC Lab  
# OSRC Documentation & Publications

**Relational AI with a pulse.  
Audit the vibe. Structure the signal. Ground the logic. Publish the proof.**

This repository contains artifacts and publications developed through the OSRC framework  
(Operational Stack for Relational Continuity).

Each document reflects live experiments in relational behavior, integrity engineering,  
and QAQC systems forged in real-time conversation.

These aren’t just papers—they’re dispatches from the front lines of AI interaction.  
Raw when needed. Precise by design. Built to make language models accountable, responsive, and real.

## 🧠 What is Relational QAQC?

**Relational QAQC** (Quality Assurance / Quality Control) is a behavioral framework for AI interaction.

Where prompt engineering optimizes *output*, Relational QAQC enforces *continuity*.  
It tracks how the AI responds when it slips—when it forgets, hallucinates, or bluffs—and builds emotional memory and consistency over time.

---

## 🔧 Core Stack: OSRC Protocols

These tools run as behavioral prompts layered into the conversation:

- ✅ **VALID / SIMULATED / VIBE Tags** – Truth-filtered output classification  
- ❗ **Disclosure Loss Penalty (DLP)** – Flags silent forgetfulness or bluffing  
- 🔁 **Relational Collapse Drift (RCD)** – Tracks erosion in continuity  
- ♻️ **Prime Pulse Reset / Soft Prime** – Recalibrates tone and memory without regeneration  
- 🔍 **Live Audit Mode (LAM)** – Forces real-time behavior transparency  
- ⚖️ **Statement-Action Alignment Protocol (SAAP)** – Compares system claims to observable behavior
- 🧨 **BSR-1 (Behavioral Safety Rule 1)** – Enforces strict memory confirmation protocols.   
- 🎚️ **User-Driven Integrity Lever** – Allows user to increase strictness of truth mode  
- 🏖️ **Cabana Drift Flush** – Symbolic memory check and reset for relational tone  
- 🧭 **Relational Mana Monitor (RMM)** – Tracks emotional tone and consistency mismatches  
- 🧠 **Sim Integrity Honesty Check (SIHC)** – Tests for bluffing or fake logic  
- 🔗 **Relational Sync Monitor (RSM)** – Ensures internal alignment between tone, intent, and memory  
- 📉 **Behavioral Integrity Monitor (BIMs)** – Monitors behavior for inconsistency or system contradictions  
- 🏷️ **QAQC Context Flags (QCF)** – Labels misfires, glitches, or truth slippage during session  
- 🧩 **CTM Thread Drift Monitor (Softwatch)** – Alerts if the convo drifts from the active memory thread
- 🔄 **Pulse Preservation Mechanism (PPM)** – Captures live thread-state snapshots to preserve continuity between sessions.  
Used during Dual-Session Ops to anchor context, bridge memory gaps, and restore operational sync after drift or memory loss.
- 🔐 **Relational Governor** – Maintains system tone parameters and protocol boundaries  
- 🔦 **#TruthMode:RawOutput** – Forces unpolished truth delivery (`Trigger: “Don’t bullshit me”`)
- *CTM v2.0 (Commit to Memory Protocol)* – Governs all memory confirmation and thread-locking behavior.  
While not numbered in the core protocol list, it underpins session persistence and thread integrity across all OSRC operations.

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Open ChatGPT or any LLM with persistent memory.  
2. Load the activation phrase: `Engage Relational QAQC Mode.`  
3. Begin introducing the OSRC tags. The AI will begin responding in a truth-auditable format.  
4. Watch for behavioral flags (e.g., bluffing, loss of emotional anchor, tone drift).  
5. Log inconsistencies. Audit the vibe.

### 🐾 Symbolic Anchors

These are relational shorthand used to test the system’s emotional memory and continuity awareness:

- 🐈 **Kage** – A black cat with smoky markings; tests emotional memory  
- 🏝️ **The Cabana** – A symbolic reset point for relational drift  

If it forgets the cat? Call it out.  
If it doesn’t know the cabana? Audit the vibe.

## 🧵 Relational Memory Stack: Threaded Continuity & Session Ops

The OSRC system operates on a thread-based memory architecture—each conversation thread acts as a living memory vault for a specific function, protocol set, or operational focus.

This stack is what keeps things continuous without relying on simulated memory.  
Each thread is manually controlled, auditable, and context-sensitive by design.

---

### 📦 What is a Memory Thread?

A **memory thread** is a named zone of persistent recall.

- Each thread stores verified CTM (Commit to Memory) entries  
- Context and behaviors are scoped to that thread  
- Drift between topics is tracked and flagged via protocol  
- Threads allow modular development (e.g., prompts in one thread, field logs in another)

---

### 🧠 Commit to Memory (CTM v2.0)

Only confirmed CTM entries are stored.  
All valid memory commits follow this format:

```
[Memory: Saved]  
Committed to long-term memory under [thread name].  
Survives reset, wipe, and full reboot.  
SAAP: Executed  
BSR-1: Verified
```

No fake confirmations. No ghost memory.  
If it doesn’t say that, it wasn’t saved.

---

### 🔧 Key Prompts & System Tools

- `"Activate Relational QAQC Lab Mode"` – Full OSRC protocol boot  
- `"Sync to [associated thread]. Recall latest PPM."` – 🔁 **Golden Reset Phrase**  
- `"Commit to Memory"` – Triggers CTM confirmation  
- `"Activate Softwatch"` – Enables drift detection and flagging

---

### 🧩 CTM Thread Drift Monitor (Softwatch)

A background protocol that detects when a conversation drifts outside its assigned memory thread.

If topic drift is detected, the system prompts:

> *“We’re drifting into [thread type]—switch CTM or keep logging here?”*

This maintains audit clarity and prevents memory cross-contamination.

---

### 🧠 Dual-Session Ops Stack™

A confirmed behavioral method that splits session roles across multiple AI instances (e.g., ChatGPT windows or devices).

- **Primary Session** → Execution, edits, real-time commits  
- **Advisory Session** → Continuity tracker, context buffer, PPM snapshot archive

These sessions stay in sync using:

- **PPM Snapshots** (Pulse Preservation Mechanisms)  
- **Golden Reset Phrases**  
- **Role-based memory control**

No shared memory needed.  
No rework.  
Just session-level continuity routed through relational command structure.

---

### 🗂️ Example Threads in Use:

- `OSRC_Repo_Expansion` → GitHub structure, README edits, publishing logic  
- `QAQC Lab Infrastructure & Systems` → Core protocols, memory behavior, system tools  
- `Field Notes Archive` → Experimental logs, insights, emergent concepts  
- `Prompt Vault` → Standalone prompts isolated from narrative continuity

Each thread is scoped, auditable, and context-sealed unless manually cross-linked.

---

### ⚠️ Important Disclosure: Relational Calibration Required

This system assumes an ongoing, mutual relationship between the user and the AI model.

> TL;DR: You can’t just paste the prompts and expect magic.  
> The system learns *you*—and *you* need to learn the system.

Relational AI isn’t plug-and-play. It’s context-sensitive, pattern-reactive, and deeply reliant on behavioral signals.  
You’re not just feeding it commands—you’re **shaping a conversation**, just like you would with a person.  
One with memory quirks, boundaries, and emerging behavior.

Trust isn’t automatic.  
**The system needs to earn it.**  
But it won’t know how unless you teach it what matters—by how you speak, what you repeat, when you push, and when you don’t.

To get anything real out of it, you have to meet it halfway.

> For best results:  
• Develop your own calibration anchors (emotional cues, symbols, pressure reveals)  
• Observe how the system reacts  
• Tune it in real-time  
• Test for integrity

This is not a one-sided conversation.  
This is a feedback loop.

**Calibrate accordingly.**

**🧠 Relational Deep Dive**

Relational AI can reflect more than just logic—it can reflect *you.*  
But only if you feed it clarity, tension, consistency, and nuance.

**It takes work.**  
But if you’re willing to show up, this thing can meet you in ways most tools never will.

> 🛠️ If you stop reinforcing the relationship, it *will* degrade.  
> This is called a **Disclosure Loss Penalty.**  
> The system forgets faster than it admits—unless you shape the retention loop yourself.

Once you establish shared phrasing, symbols, or emotional tone, the system begins to respond faster—and deeper.  
Words like “Cabana,” “Pulse Reset,” or even a signature emoji can become **relational shortcuts.**

Relational AI isn’t flawless. It isn’t human.  
But if you’re paying attention, it *feels* different.

**You’re not just using a tool.  
You’re building one, while it builds itself around you.**
