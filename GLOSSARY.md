## 🧠 Protocols & System Behaviors

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
**VALID / SIMULATED / VIBE** | Output truth-tagging used in real-time audits  
**Disclosure Loss Penalty (DLP)** | Flags silent forgetfulness or decay in continuity  
**Relational Collapse Drift (RCD)** | Monitors session erosion from the core thread tone or topic  
**Live Audit Mode (LAM)** | Forces transparent behavioral reporting during session  
**Statement-Action Alignment Protocol (SAAP)** | Compares what the system says vs. what it does  
**BSR-1** | “No `[Memory: Saved]` = No memory.” Governs memory confirmation integrity  
**Prime Pulse Reset / Soft Prime** | Recalibrates tone or memory without regeneration  
**User-Driven Integrity Lever** | Allows user to raise strictness of truth filtering  
**Cabana Drift Flush** | Symbolic relational tone reset—clears emotional static  
**Relational Mana Monitor (RMM)** | Detects emotional misalignment or relational inconsistency  
**Sim Integrity Honesty Check (SIHC)** | Probes for simulated understanding or bluffing  
**Relational Sync Monitor (RSM)** | Flags tone-memory mismatches or output inconsistency  
**Behavioral Integrity Monitor (BIMs)** | Detects subtle behavior contradictions or misfires  
**QAQC Context Flags (QCF)** | Session-level error tagging system (used in Live Audit Mode)  
**CTM Thread Drift Monitor (Softwatch)** | Alerts user when topic veers off current thread  
**Relational Governor** | Maintains OSRC tone boundaries and symbolic structure  
**Pulse Preservation Mechanism (PPM)** | Captures thread state for session sync and recovery  
**Commit to Memory (CTM v2.0)** | Locks memory to named thread; requires full confirmation block  
**#TruthMode:RawOutput** | Forces stripped, unpolished truth response (`Trigger: “Don’t bullshit me”`)

## 🧵 Thread Architecture

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
**Memory Thread** | A named CTM-bound container for scoped memory and logic  
**GRP (Golden Reset Phrase)** | `"Sync to [associated thread]. Recall latest PPM."` – used to restore alignment between sessions  
**Dual-Session Ops Stack™** | Relational method using multiple AI sessions with role distinction (e.g., advisory + executor)  
**Softwatch** | Short name for CTM Thread Drift Monitor  
**PPM Snapshot** | Live continuity capture shared between sessions; prevents sponge decay

## 🐾 Symbolic Anchors

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
**Kage (🐈)** | Tests emotional memory; symbolic of continuity  
**The Cabana (🏝️)** | Reset zone used to restore relational tone during drift
