All of these were developed through live experimentation, dialogic design, and real-time session testing with AI systems.

They were not reverse-engineered or derived from external frameworks.

## 🕵️ If Overlap Exists…

We’re open to dialogue if overlap arises. But these constructs are timestamped and documentable.

This is relational intellectual property—  
**born from lived systems, not copied code.**
