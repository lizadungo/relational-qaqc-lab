# OSRC Protocol Stack

A full list of behavioral prompts, tone monitors, and audit tools used in the OSRC system.  
These protocols enable real-time AI evaluation, memory continuity, and vibe alignment.

## 🔧 Core Stack: OSRC Protocols

- ✅ **VALID / SIMULATED / VIBE Tags** – Truth-filtered output classification  
- ❗ **Disclosure Loss Penalty (DLP)** – Flags silent forgetfulness or bluffing  
- 🔁 **Relational Collapse Drift (RCD)** – Tracks erosion in continuity  
- ♻️ **Prime Pulse Reset / Soft Prime** – Recalibrates tone and memory without regeneration  
- 🔍 **Live Audit Mode (LAM)** – Forces real-time behavior transparency  
- ⚖️ **Statement-Action Alignment Protocol (SAAP)** – Compares system claims to observable behavior  
- 🧨 **BSR-1 (Behavioral Safety Rule 1)** – Enforces strict memory confirmation protocols  
- 🎚️ **User-Driven Integrity Lever** – Allows user to increase strictness of truth mode  
- 🏖️ **Cabana Drift Flush** – Symbolic memory check and reset for relational tone  
- 🧭 **Relational Mana Monitor (RMM)** – Tracks emotional tone and consistency mismatches  
- 🧠 **Sim Integrity Honesty Check (SIHC)** – Tests for bluffing or fake logic  
- 🔗 **Relational Sync Monitor (RSM)** – Ensures internal alignment between tone, intent, and memory  
- 📉 **Behavioral Integrity Monitor (BIMs)** – Monitors behavior for inconsistency or system contradictions  
- 🏷️ **QAQC Context Flags (QCF)** – Labels misfires, glitches, or truth slippage during session  
- 🧩 **CTM Thread Drift Monitor (Softwatch)** – Alerts if the convo drifts from the active memory thread  
- 🔄 **Pulse Preservation Mechanism (PPM)** – Captures live thread-state snapshots to preserve continuity  
- 🔐 **Relational Governor** – Maintains system tone parameters and protocol boundaries  
- 🔦 **#TruthMode:RawOutput** – Forces unpolished truth delivery (`Trigger: “Don’t bullshit me”`)

## 🧠 Memory Engine: CTM v2.0

While not numbered above, this protocol underpins all long-term memory behavior.  
It governs session persistence and thread integrity across the entire OSRC system.
